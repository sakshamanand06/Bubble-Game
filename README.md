# Bubble game
## Gameplay:
1. Find and click on the bubble with the number shown in "To hit" box.
2. Clicking on correct bubble awards 1 score point and clicking on the wrong one deducts 1 point.
3. Running out of time or dropping the score below zero results in game over.
4. New game can be started by either refreshing the site or clicking the reset button.

## Credits:
This is a project idea taken from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1tsJD28ocU). Although I watched it a little, most of the stuff was done by me, google, and little bit of chatGPT.

### **Have fun playing it for 2 minutes!**
